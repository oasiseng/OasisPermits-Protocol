### **1. Introduction**

The OasisPermits Protocol establishes a gold standard for legally compliant, AI-assisted plan review workflows for single-trade residential permits in accordance with:

* Florida HB 683 (2025)
* 2023 Florida Building Code (FBC)
* 2023 National Electrical Code (NEC)
* International Residential Code (IRC)
* ISO 19650 (Information Management for the Built Environment)

Our mission is to democratize and accelerate permit approvals by combining licensed engineering oversight with AI-based automation tools.

### **2. Legal Foundation**

#### **2.1. Florida Statute – HB 683 (Effective July 1, 2025)**

* Defines a "permit application" to include plans reviewed by a private provider using software-based systems
* Permits private providers to review and inspect single-trade systems (e.g. solar, electrical, structural) using automated systems
* Requires local building departments to issue permits or flag deficiencies within 5 business days
* Allows virtual inspections and reviews for single-family and two-family dwellings

#### **2.2. Other Codes Referenced**

* **IRC & IBC**: Used for framing, structural spans, load paths, etc.
* **NEC**: Used for panel upgrades, solar, and other electrical scopes
* **FBC**: Primary governing body for residential design
* **ISO 19650**: Serves as reference for information management and QA systems

---

### **3. Scope of Review**

This protocol applies to single-trade residential projects such as:

* Structural Pergolas, Awnings, Carports
* Panel Upgrades, Service Changes (Electrical)
* Solar PV + ESS
* HVAC Replacement
* Generator Installs
* Water Heater / Tankless Retrofits

Scope exclusions:

* Multi-trade projects
* New home construction
* Commercial/multifamily

### **4. System Workflow Overview**

**Step 1:** Client submits digital PDF plans + address via portal
**Step 2:** Plans are classified by project type using AI
**Step 3:** Jurisdiction + wind zone + zoning rules pulled via API
**Step 4:** AI logic tree performs checklist-based code scan
**Step 5:** Engineer-in-the-loop reviews flagged issues
**Step 6:** Pass/fail status is issued, and PE digitally signs if compliant
**Step 7:** Permit affidavit is generated + submitted to AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction)

---

### **5. Code Compliance Checks**

Each AI review includes these checks:

* **FBC**:

  * Wind load per ASCE 7
  * Connection and uplift resistance
  * Structural spans
  * HVHZ/NOA compliance (if applicable)
* **NEC**:

  * Panel sizing and conductor ampacity
  * Disconnect and labeling
  * Grounding and bonding
* **IRC**:

  * Foundation anchorage
  * Roof/wall span tables
  * Snow/wind/seismic exposure (as applicable)

---

### **6. Outputs**

For each submission, the OasisPermits Protocol generates:

* AI Review Report (PDF summary)
* Signed/sealed plan set (PDF)
* Affidavit of Compliance per HB 683
* Permit Application Cover Sheet (auto-filled)

---

### **7. Risk & Liability**

* All plans must be reviewed and signed by a licensed PE (Florida)
* This protocol does **not** guarantee zoning, HOA, or site-specific approval
* Site plan and contractor details are required for final permit
* Refunds only available if plan fails compliance due to AI error and cannot be manually corrected

---

### **8. Future Features (v2+)**

* AI zoning feedback + GIS site plans
* Jurisdiction-specific export bundles
* Full multi-trade support (HVAC + plumbing + solar)
* Continuous code training from permit feedback loop

---

### **9. Intellectual Property & License**

This protocol is the intellectual property of Oasis Engineering LLC. Reproduction or reuse without written permission is prohibited.

Future licensing models may include:

* White-label platform for other engineers
* Affiliate private provider onboarding
* Permit pass subscription for contractors or builders

---

### **10. Conclusion**

OasisPermits Protocol v1.0 introduces a compliant, scalable, and transformative approach to permit plan review. By combining AI logic with engineering oversight and real legal pathways (HB 683), we enable a faster, smarter, and more accessible permitting process across Florida — and eventually the nation.

**Let’s build smarter.**
